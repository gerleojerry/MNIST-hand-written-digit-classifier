The problem statment of this is project is to create a model that predicts the handwritten digit using pytorch a python deep learning framework.

The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 images of hand written digit. Where each image has size 28X28.The MNIST stands for Modified National institute of standard and technology. It consists of 10 different classes ranging from 0â€“9 . It means the problem we are going to approach is multiclass classification problem. On this Blog you will understand the basic Pytorch implementation.

The accuracy of the model is 98.2%
